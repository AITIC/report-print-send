Report to printer - Paper tray selection
========================================

**Author:** Camptocamp SA

*This module extends `Report to printer` module.*

It detects trays on printer installation plus permits to select the
paper source on which you want to print directly.

You will find this option on default user config, on default report
config and on specific config per user per report.

This allows you to dedicate a specific paper source for exemple for
preprinted paper such as payment slip.
